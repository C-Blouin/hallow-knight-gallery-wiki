The Hallow Knight Gallery Wiki was my first small JavaScript project to understand basic browser document manipulation. This project allows users to browse the various locations throughout the popular video game Hallow Knight and gain insightful information alongside viewing additional images on photograph click.

Here is the link to the live Application: https://c-blouin.github.io/hallow-knight-gallery-wiki/
